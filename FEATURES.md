## 📝 NOTES

### Performance Considerations
- Wind system adds computational overhead - monitor with large populations
- Pollen grain tracking scales O(n) with grain count - may need optimization
- Genetic distance calculations could be expensive - consider caching
- Network systems will require efficient spatial indexing

### Design Philosophy
- Maintain realistic biological principles
- Allow emergent behaviors rather than hard-coding outcomes
- Keep systems modular and testable
- Prioritize features that create interesting evolutionary dynamics

### Technical Debt
- Consider refactoring plant reproduction system for clarity
- Wind system could benefit from spatial partitioning optimization
- CLI view system could use better organization as views increase
