## 🎯 NEXT STEPS

### Immediate Tasks (Next Session)
1. **Advanced Biome Interactions**: Implement dynamic biome-to-biome transitions and ecosystem boundaries
2. **Enhanced Pollinator Specialization**: Develop deeper co-evolutionary pressure between specific plant-pollinator pairs  
3. **Climate Change Response Systems**: Add ecosystem-wide adaptive responses to environmental pressures
4. **Advanced Collective Intelligence**: Enhance hive mind systems with cross-species knowledge sharing

### Short-term Goals (Next 2-3 Sessions)
1. **Multi-Species Intelligence Networks**: Allow neural networks to share learned behaviors across compatible species
2. **Advanced Environmental Simulation**: Expand environmental pressure systems with more realistic long-term climate modeling
3. **Enhanced Social Structures**: Develop more complex inter-colony relationships and territorial dynamics
4. **Adaptive Neural Architectures**: Allow neural networks to evolve their own structures based on environmental needs

### Long-term Vision
Create a fully realistic evolutionary ecosystem where:
- Advanced neural networks drive sophisticated intelligent behaviors and cross-species learning
- Multi-species collective intelligence creates complex social structures and knowledge networks
- Dynamic environmental pressures continuously shape both genetic and neural evolution
- Complex inter-colony politics and warfare drive territorial expansion and resource competition
- Plant-insect mutualism creates intricate ecological webs and co-evolutionary pressure
- Multiple reproduction and dispersal strategies exist including sophisticated pheromone communication
- Complex social structures (colonies, hives, castes) interact and compete in dynamic ways
- Regional weather patterns create diverse microenvironments that drive specialized evolution
- Extreme weather events drive evolutionary adaptation toward more sophisticated social organization
- Multi-generational knowledge transfer creates lasting cultural evolution alongside genetic evolution

## 📝 NOTES

### Performance Considerations
- Wind system adds computational overhead - monitor with large populations
- Pollen grain tracking scales O(n) with grain count - may need optimization
- Genetic distance calculations could be expensive - consider caching
- Network systems will require efficient spatial indexing

### Design Philosophy
- Maintain realistic biological principles
- Allow emergent behaviors rather than hard-coding outcomes
- Keep systems modular and testable
- Prioritize features that create interesting evolutionary dynamics

### Technical Debt
- Consider refactoring plant reproduction system for clarity
- Wind system could benefit from spatial partitioning optimization
- CLI view system could use better organization as views increase
